    My name is Charly Huang and I am a software engineer interested in autonomous navigation related algorithms and software development. Since I was little I was fascinated by self-driving robots. And this passion has always motivated me to pursue degrees and careers in related fields. As of today, there are still a great number of issues in the autonomous driving realm waiting to be overcome in order to make automated vehicles safe and reliable. To this end,I want to contribute head-on and hands-on to make autonomous driving a true reality in the near future. I love to solve problems creatively from the big picture all the way down to the details. I take pride in creating beautiful designs and implementing them that not only bring solutions, but also boost maintainability and scalability. I know that every step in crafting the product comes with great responsibility but one inch closer to fulfilling the mission.
