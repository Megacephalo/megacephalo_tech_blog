Hi there!!

This is Charly Huang. I am so gload that I can finally put up a blog of my own after so many years of working in the robotics industry and not really feel the need to update anything. And yet here I am, I think it is time to jot down everything I know and also have this blog as a reminder that I need to keep rolling on. So...here it is, my very first GitHub pages to write down anything I've learned along the years to build an amazing robotics application that hopefully can make this world a little bit better. 

Without further due, let's begin!
